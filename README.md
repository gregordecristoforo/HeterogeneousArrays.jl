# HeterogeneousArrays.jl
This repository introduces a type called HeterogeneousVector, a segmented array designed to hold elements of different concrete types while maintaining efficient, type-stable broadcasting.

The goal of this project is to generalize the prototype from [COMBAT.jl](https://github.com/yaccos/COMBAT.jl) into a more versatile and reusable package.
